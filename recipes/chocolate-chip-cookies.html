                    <li>2 cups milk chocolate chips</li>

            <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                        Grease 2 cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Whisk both flours and baking soda together in a medium bowl.</li>
                    <li>Cream the brown sugar, chocolate-hazelnut spread, butter, 
                        and white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer. 
                        Beat in eggs and vanilla.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture; stir until 
                        a stiff dough forms. Mix in chocolate chips and rainbow 
                        chocolate chips.</li>
                    <li>Roll dough into 2-inch balls. Place 1 to 2 inches apart 
                        onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies have risen, 
                        10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 
                        10 minutes; cookies will firm up as they cool. 
                        Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                </ol>
