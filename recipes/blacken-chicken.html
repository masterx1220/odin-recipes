        <p><h3>Steps for chicken preparation.</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all seasonings in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Using a small amount of olive oil coat the chick breast, 
                    then apply the seasonings.</li>
                <li>Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees.</li>
                <li>Get a skillet and coat the bottom with enough olive 
                    oil to blacken the chicken. From there turn the heat on
                     high until the oil is hot enought to blacken the chicken. 
                     Put chicken in skillet and let it sear for about 4 minutes. 
                     Once all the chicken has been blackened place on a pan and 
                     insert into the oven for 20 minutes. Make sure to check on 
                     the chicken using a themometer to make sure it is cooked 
                     all the way through. </li>
            </ol>
            
        <p><h3>Steps for Tortellini and sauce preparation</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Insert Vodak sauce in a sauce pan and set the heat to a low 
                    simmer. From here add your seasonings for your desired taste. 
                    I added a generous amounts of queso and extra sharp shredded 
                    cheddar cheese along with tajin seasonings and some cayenne 
                    powder and smoked paprika for a little kick. Remember to stir
                    the sauce occausionally.</li>
                <li>In a large pan add your desired amount of water and a bit of 
                    salt. Bring the salted water to a boil and add your tortellini.
                    Bring water back to a boil and cook pasta to desired tenderness.
                    Drain pasta using strainer and return pasta to the large pan.
                </li>
                <li>Combine the vodka sauce and the tortellini along with your chicken
                    and enjoy!
                </li>
