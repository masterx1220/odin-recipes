# odin-recipes
This current project will have me create a webpage detailing a recipe that i fancy. 

Creating this webpage will have me develope and cement the skills i have lerned so far, such as: 
    1. Adding code and  commiting changes something meaningful was added.  
    2. Creating a basic website using the boiler-plate template (At least I think it's a template)
    3. Using correct format (h1, em, strong,p)
    4. Adding pictures and links
    5. Becoming adept with using the command line in linux.
